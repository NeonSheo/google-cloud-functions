#Gooogle Cloud Functions Course
## Starting a proyect
To start a new proyect in Google Cloud, we can go to the 
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) or
create it from [Google Cloud PLatform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
## Creating a virtual environment
First we have to install `python3-venv` with the following
command:
```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
Then, we execute the following command:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment we do:
```
venv\scripts\activate.bat
```
In order to add new packages to our new virtual environment
we create a file called `requirements.txt` and execute
the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
